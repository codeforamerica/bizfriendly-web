How to City Web Site
=========

How to City teaches you how to use the internet to increase your quality of life, be more effecient at work, and perhaps even how to be a better citizen.

## <a name="about"></a>About
This is the main website for the How to City service. It is powered by the [How to City API](http://github.com/codeforamerica/howtocity-api)

## <a name="development-setup"></a>Development Setup
How to City's website is just javascript and html. Run it on any webserver you'd like. I recommend forking this repository and letting github [host it for you](https://help.github.com/categories/20/articles).
