		<h2 id="why">Why are we building it?</h2>
		<p>Charged with the topic of economic development, the Code for America fellows conducted <a href="http://cfakc.tumblr.com/process">a research and ideation process</a> and discovered a need for improving digital literacy in Kansas City as means to economic development.</p>

		<p>Kansas City has an amazing business community with over <a href="http://www.bizjournals.com/kansascity/blog/2012/07/kansas-city-ranks-26th-for-small.html">48,000 small businesses</a>. That’s in the top 3% among the nation’s 938 metropolitan and micropolitan areas! Kansas City also has a digital advantage by becoming one of the most Internet-connected cities in the country through <a href="https://fiber.google.com/about/">Google Fiber</a> and other local initiatives, such as <a href="http://www.connectingforgood.org/">Connecting for Good</a>.</p>

		<p>But amongst Kansas Citians, there’s a drop off in web skills beyond the very basics.<p>
		<img src="img/digital-skills-chart.png" class="img-responsive">
		<p>There’s room for improvement to to make Kansas City small business owners the most digitally literate in the country and BizFriend.ly will help achieve that.</p>

	  <h2 id="use">Can I use BizFriend.ly in my city?</h2>
		<p>A resounding yes! 
	While created with Kansas City, we’d love to see more cities use BizFriend.ly as it can help people learn and teach online absolutely anywhere. There are two types of resue:
		<ul>
		  <li><span class="bold">Reaching Business Owners:</span> If you’d also like to reach business owners in your city, you can link directly to BizFriend.ly as it currently exists. Most of the content on BizFriend.ly is general to the web and usable by business owners regardless of location. If you’d like to add specific content about doing business with your city or state, you can add new content under Doing Business With Your City or Doing Business With Your State. Please also let us know if you’d like to start using BizFriend.ly in your community.</li>
		  <li><span class="bold">Reaching Other Audiences:</span> The core platform is built in a way that you can easily reuse BizFriend.ly to reach new audiences. You’d want to create a new brand, and likely new content focused on the audience. You can find out more about the technical side of reusing the platform on our <a href="https://github.com/codeforamerica/bizfriendly-web/">Github repository</a>.</li></ul> </p>
